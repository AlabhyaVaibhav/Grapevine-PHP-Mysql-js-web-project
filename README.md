# Grapevine - PHP, Mysql, js web project

Usually students seek precise and brief annotations right before the examinations for getting a summary or quick revision of their syllabus. But being Engineering students, we seek notes for a first glance at the curriculum on the night before the exam. We tend to look for something compact, systematic,labor-saving and well ordered. This Portal serves the very purpose. So you can put your mind at ease and find all the study material related to our subjects including the ones that you've probably missed while it was circulated. You will find it all here, whatever you need, whenever you need it. You won't have to waste more time in hunting for notes for regular revisions Or for Mid/End Semester preparations.

## Project Experience

As a fresher in college this is my first project. This web app is based on php, html, js, running on apache server with mysql database.
